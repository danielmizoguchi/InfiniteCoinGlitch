# InfiniteCoinGlitch

The objective of this repository is to create a platform for simulating a series of trading strategies via the Backtrader library. The project is purely for academic purposes and my own self-interest in learning to backtest and implement a range of trading strategies using real-life data with the ultimate goal of transitioning promising algorithms into production via cloud-based services such as QuantConnect.
